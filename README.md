# Chat Application System Design & Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the system design and data architecture for a real-time chat application built with Next.js and Firebase. The application supports one-to-one and group messaging with text, media, and file sharing capabilities.

## Quick Start

This chat application uses:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with App Router
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore for data storage (Not Implemented yet)
- **Media Storage**: Firebase Storage for files and images (Not Implemented yet)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (Not Implemented yet)
- **Serverless Functions**: Firebase Cloud Functions for notifications and background tasks (Not Implemented yet)

## Key Features

- One-to-one and group conversations
- Media and file sharing
- Message editing and deletion
- Real-time messaging (Not Implemented yet)
- Read receipts and typing indicators (Not Implemented yet)
- User presence (online/offline status) (Not Implemented yet)

## Architecture Overview

The application will follow a serverless architecture pattern with Firebase as the backend in the future. The frontend is built with Next.js 15 App Router, leveraging server components for improved performance using client components and Framer motion for interactive elements.

For detailed architecture information, see [ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md](ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md).

## Implementation Notes

- The application planned to use Firebase SDK with modular imports
- Real-time updates will be implemented using Firestore listeners
- The frontend uses React Server Components where possible, with client components for interactive elements
- Authentication state is managed globally using a custom auth context (Not Implemented yet)
